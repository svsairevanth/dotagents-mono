## UI Audit Log

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 24: Mobile Settings desktop-management list rows under narrow widths and larger text

- Area selected:
  - mobile `apps/mobile/src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx`
- Why this chunk: chunk 23 fixed the visible top-level mobile Settings controls and explicitly called out the deeper desktop-settings management lists as the next strongest unlogged pressure point. Those rows (profiles / MCP servers / skills / memories / agents / loops) all share the same dense title/meta/action treatment, so one conservative pass could improve several related sub-sections at once.
- Audit method:
  - re-read `ui-audit.md` first to keep the work unique
  - inspected the desktop-settings list sections in `SettingsScreen.tsx` directly (`Profile & Model`, `MCP Servers`, `Skills`, `Memories`, `Agents`, `Agent Loops`)
  - attempted a live mobile web inspection again via `pnpm --filter @dotagents/mobile web`; the deeper desktop-management lists were still not reachable in the current app state, so the concrete fixes were driven by code inspection of the shared row styles
  - after the code change, re-ran a live regression check on the visible top-level Settings screen to ensure the shared style updates did not introduce new overflow/clipping

#### Findings

- The management-list rows still had several width/zoom assumptions even after the top-level Settings pass:
  - profile rows kept the name/default marker and checkmark in a rigid one-line row, so long profile names could crowd the checkmark
  - the profile import/export buttons assumed two equal inline buttons with no wrap escape hatch, which would be fragile once labels changed to `Importing...` / `Exporting...` or text scaling increased
  - the shared `serverRow` / `serverInfo` / `serverNameRow` / `agentActions` styles assumed one-line titles plus fixed inline action space, which affects MCP servers, skills, memories, agents, and loops together
  - agent descriptions and loop metadata were more aggressively truncated than necessary for a mobile settings surface that already allows variable-height rows

#### Changes made

- Hardened profile management rows in `SettingsScreen.tsx`:
  - made `profileItem` top-align and gap its content instead of assuming a single-line name/checkmark row
  - made `profileName` shrink-safe with a two-line cap
  - made the import/export action row wrap-aware, with buttons that keep a consistent tap height and stack cleanly when width gets tight
- Refined the shared management-list row contract used across desktop-settings sections:
  - made `serverRow` wrap-safe and top-aligned instead of relying on `justifyContent: 'space-between'`
  - added `minWidth: 0` / `flexShrink` treatment to the shared info/title text styles so long names and badges can wrap without pushing actions out of bounds
  - let the agent action cluster stay fixed-width while the text column yields first
  - widened the agent description and loop metadata to two lines so these rows degrade more gracefully on mobile
- Minor follow-up from the regression pass: tightened `themeOptionText` slightly so the visible top-level `Appearance` control stays more balanced at ~280px while remaining overflow-safe.

#### Verification

- Targeted mobile typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/mobile exec tsc --noEmit`
- Live mobile web regression checks at `http://localhost:8081` after `pnpm --filter @dotagents/mobile web`:
  - confirmed the deeper desktop-management lists are not reachable in the current app state
  - re-checked the visible top-level Settings screen around `320px` and `280px` widths to confirm the shared style changes did not introduce horizontal overflow or clipping

#### Notes

- Because the affected management-list sections were not reachable live in the current state, this chunk is primarily a code-inspection-driven hardening pass rather than a full visual runtime audit.
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: the mobile nested settings/editor screens (`ConnectionSettingsScreen`, `AgentEditScreen`, `MemoryEditScreen`, `LoopEditScreen`) are still unlogged and now stand out as the next best mobile surfaces to inspect directly.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 23: Mobile Settings top-level controls at narrow widths and larger text

- Area selected:
  - mobile `apps/mobile/src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx`
  - adjacent mobile `apps/mobile/src/ui/TTSSettings.tsx`
- Why this chunk: I checked `ui-audit.md` first and avoided the already-logged desktop/shared chunks. The mobile top-level Settings surface was still unclaimed, and a live pass showed the connection card, theme selector, toggle rows, and TTS voice selector were the highest-value narrow-width/zoom pressure point still untouched.
- Audit method:
  - re-read `ui-audit.md` first to keep the work unique
  - reused `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md` plus the repo design guidance/docs (`README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/AGENTS.md`) to stay grounded in the repo’s Electron/mobile debugging guidance and cross-platform design expectations
  - inspected `SettingsScreen.tsx` and `TTSSettings.tsx` directly
  - ran the mobile app via `pnpm --filter @dotagents/mobile web` and live-checked the initial Settings screen at ~320px / 280px plus higher zoom states to confirm real layout behavior before and after the change

#### Findings

- The mobile Settings screen’s top controls had a few subtle but repeatable responsiveness issues:
  - the connection card URL was limited to a single line, which made long server URLs feel fragile under narrow widths and zoom
  - the theme selector used equal-width pills without wrap-aware sizing, so it either got cramped or needed a better compact/wrap balance
  - the generic label/switch rows were visually tighter than they needed to be once labels wrapped under zoom
  - the `TTSSettings` voice selector capped itself with a rigid width assumption, which made the selected voice value more likely to clip or crowd the chevron at extreme narrow/zoom combinations

#### Changes made

- Refined the top-level mobile Settings chrome in `SettingsScreen.tsx`:
  - let the connection card URL wrap to two lines and added explicit `minWidth: 0` / wrap-safe containment for the card title + status row
  - made the shared row treatment top-align its controls with a consistent gap so long labels wrap more cleanly beside switches
  - kept labels shrink-safe instead of assuming one-line copy
  - reworked the theme selector into a wrap-aware control that stays compact at normal 320px/280px widths while still reflowing safely under tighter zoom
- Hardened the adjacent `TTSSettings.tsx` voice row:
  - allowed the voice row to wrap when needed
  - widened/shrank the selector more gracefully with a full-width cap and a smaller minimum width
  - let the selected voice label use up to two lines so `System Default` and similar values stay readable without pushing the chevron out of bounds

#### Verification

- Targeted mobile typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/mobile exec tsc --noEmit`
- Live mobile web re-checks at `http://localhost:8081` after `pnpm --filter @dotagents/mobile web`:
  - checked the initial Settings screen around `320px` and `280px` widths
  - re-checked higher zoom states (~`125%` / `150%`) to confirm no page-level horizontal overflow and to verify the TTS selector edge case was resolved

#### Notes

- This chunk stays mobile-scoped: there is no direct desktop equivalent for the top-level mobile Settings screen chrome, so no desktop file changes were needed here.
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: the still-unlogged mobile `SettingsScreen` desktop-settings management lists (profiles / memories / agents / loops) are the next strongest narrow-width and large-text pressure point.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 22: Shared predefined prompts menu under compact header/composer widths and zoom

- Area selected:
  - shared desktop `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/predefined-prompts-menu.tsx`
  - cross-checked dense call sites in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/sessions.tsx`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/text-input-panel.tsx`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/overlay-follow-up-input.tsx`, and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/tile-follow-up-input.tsx`
- Why this chunk: I checked `ui-audit.md` first and continued with the unlogged follow-up explicitly called out in chunk 21. The shared prompts menu sits in the same dense desktop header/composer chrome as `AgentSelector`, so it was the best next place to improve width/zoom resilience without overlapping prior work.
- Audit method:
  - re-read `ui-audit.md` first to avoid duplicating prior chunks
  - reused `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md` plus the repo design guidance/docs (`README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/AGENTS.md`) to keep the pass grounded in the Electron-first desktop renderer constraints and the required mobile cross-check
  - launched the desktop app with `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9383 ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS="--inspect=9389" pnpm dev -- -d`; Electron-native inspection again attached to the shell document with an empty `#root`, so the concrete audit relied on the shared component plus its renderer call sites
  - inspected the shared trigger/dropdown rows directly and traced how compact trigger sizing behaves inside sessions headers and composer action rows
  - cross-checked `apps/mobile/src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx`; mobile has a composer/send surface, but no equivalent predefined prompt tray, so this chunk remained desktop-only

#### Findings

- The shared prompts menu still assumed a relatively roomy desktop dropdown:
  - the menu used a fixed `w-64 max-h-80` footprint, which gave long prompt names/content and skill names/descriptions very little room under narrower windows or font zoom
  - prompt rows only showed a single truncated name line, so users lost almost all prompt-content context before selecting
  - skill rows also collapsed to a single truncated name line even though `AgentSkill` exposes descriptions that could help differentiate similar entries
- The prompt-management controls were cramped for a high-zoom polish pass:
  - edit/delete buttons were only `h-5 w-5`, so they felt cramped beside long labels and were small hit targets compared with nearby desktop chrome
  - the row layout used `items-center justify-between` without a stronger `min-w-0 items-start` contract, making it more fragile once text wrapped or the actions needed room
- The trigger itself also needed compact-context polish:
  - it had no explicit `aria-label`
  - it ignored its `buttonSize` prop, so the shared icon button stayed visually larger than adjacent `h-6` / `h-7` action buttons inside the text-input and overlay follow-up composers

#### Changes made

- Refined the shared trigger and dropdown in `predefined-prompts-menu.tsx`:
  - respected `buttonSize` for icon-only footprint presets while still allowing call-site overrides via `className`
  - added `aria-label="Open predefined prompts"`
  - widened the menu to a viewport-aware `w-[min(26rem,calc(100vw-2rem))] max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]` and bounded height with `max-h-[min(32rem,calc(100vh-2rem))]`
  - softened section headers into compact uppercase labels for quicker scanning
- Reworked prompt and skill rows for better width/zoom resilience:
  - switched rows to `min-w-0 items-start gap-2.5`
  - promoted prompt/skill names to stronger truncated title lines with hover titles
  - added wrap-safe two-line secondary previews from `prompt.content` and `skill.description`
  - enlarged edit/delete controls to `h-7 w-7` and added explicit `aria-label`s per prompt
  - made empty-state copy opt into wrap-safe overflow handling too
- Tightened the compact composer call sites so the shared trigger fits the surrounding chrome:
  - `text-input-panel.tsx` now pins the trigger to `h-6 w-6` beside the image button
  - `overlay-follow-up-input.tsx` now requests `buttonSize="sm"` to match its neighboring `h-7 w-7` controls
  - `tile-follow-up-input.tsx` was reviewed and already had a compact `h-6 w-6` override, so no additional change was needed there
- Added `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/predefined-prompts-menu.layout.test.ts` so the trigger/menu preview contract now has focused regression coverage.

#### Verification

- Targeted test: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/components/predefined-prompts-menu.layout.test.ts src/renderer/src/components/agent-selector.layout.test.ts`
- Targeted web typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck:web`

#### Notes

- This chunk stays desktop-only/shared-component scoped: mobile `ChatScreen` has a composer, but no equivalent quick-prompt trigger/menu to keep in sync.
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: fully audit the compact follow-up composers (`apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/overlay-follow-up-input.tsx` and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/tile-follow-up-input.tsx`) for any remaining trailing-action, attachment-strip, and placeholder/agent-label pressure under narrow widths and zoom.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 21: Shared AgentSelector trigger/menu resilience under narrow widths and zoom

- Area selected:
  - shared desktop `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-selector.tsx`
  - cross-checked dense call sites in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/sessions.tsx` and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/session-input.tsx`
- Why this chunk: I checked `ui-audit.md` first and skipped the already-logged shared audio/TTS player work from chunk 20 so this pass stayed unique. `AgentSelector` was still unclaimed, yet it appears in dense session-start headers and input chrome where long names, zoom, and narrow windows create the most pressure.
- Audit method:
  - re-read `ui-audit.md` first to avoid overlapping prior chunks
  - reused `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md` plus the repo design guidance/docs (`README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/AGENTS.md`) to keep the audit grounded in the Electron renderer constraints and the desktop/mobile cross-check requirement
  - inspected `agent-selector.tsx` directly and traced its session-start call sites in `pages/sessions.tsx` and `session-input.tsx`
  - cross-checked the mobile equivalent in `apps/mobile/src/ui/AgentSelectorSheet.tsx`; it already uses a bounded `flex: 1` info column and one-line secondary text, so this pass remained desktop-only

#### Findings

- The desktop selector trigger only truncated the label itself (`max-w-[120px] truncate`) without giving the button a full `min-w-0` / bounded-width contract, so it behaved inconsistently inside dense wrapped headers.
- The trigger icon and chevron were not explicitly `shrink-0`, which made the compact control more fragile once neighboring buttons and text competed for width.
- The dropdown menu had no viewport-aware width bound, so long agent names/descriptions had limited room to breathe and could produce an awkwardly cramped or overly wide panel depending on context.
- The dropdown rows did not consistently declare `min-w-0 flex-1` for the text column or top-align the checkmark, which made long names/descriptions feel cramped under zoom.

#### Changes made

- Refined the shared selector trigger in `agent-selector.tsx`:
  - added `min-w-0` plus a viewport-aware `max-w-[min(13rem,calc(100vw-2rem))]` contract so the compact selector stays bounded in session headers and text-input chrome
  - made the label `min-w-0 flex-1 truncate text-left`
  - marked the bot icon and chevron `shrink-0`
  - added `title={displayName}` so truncated agent names still reveal their full value on hover
- Hardened the dropdown menu treatment:
  - bounded the menu content to `w-[min(24rem,calc(100vw-2rem))] max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]`
  - switched items to `min-w-0 items-start gap-2` with top-aligned `Check` icons
  - made the text column `min-w-0 flex-1 space-y-0.5`
  - promoted agent names to a stronger truncated title line and widened descriptions to a wrap-safe two-line clamp with `overflow-wrap:anywhere`
- Added `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-selector.layout.test.ts` so the trigger/menu layout contract now has direct regression coverage.

#### Verification

- Targeted test: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/components/agent-selector.layout.test.ts`
- Regression check: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/components/audio-player.layout.test.ts src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts`
- Targeted web typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck:web`

#### Notes

- This chunk stays desktop/shared-component scoped: the mobile `AgentSelectorSheet` already had a bounded `profileInfo` column and did not need the same trigger/menu fixes.
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: the adjacent `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/predefined-prompts-menu.tsx` is still unlogged and shares the same dense header/dropdown pressure profile as `AgentSelector`.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 20: Shared compact audio/TTS player chrome under narrow widths and zoom

- Area selected:
  - shared desktop `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/audio-player.tsx`
  - adjacent compact TTS/error call sites in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tsx` and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/session-tile.tsx`
- Why this chunk: chunk 19 tightened the queue/retry status chrome surrounding compact session footers, which left the shared `AudioPlayer` itself as the next unclaimed pressure point. It is reused inside mid-turn responses, past-response history, and queue/retry flows, so any narrow-width weakness propagates across several sessions surfaces.
- Audit method:
  - checked `ui-audit.md` first to avoid overlapping the already-started chunks 18 and 19
  - reused `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md` plus the repo design guidance/docs (`README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/AGENTS.md`) to keep the audit grounded in the Electron renderer constraints
  - inspected `audio-player.tsx` directly and cross-checked where it is embedded in compact session/message chrome
  - tightened the adjacent desktop TTS/error wrappers in `agent-progress.tsx` and `session-tile.tsx` so the shared player changes were reflected at the call sites too
  - compared it against the adjacent queue/retry and response-history fixes already logged to keep the treatment consistent

#### Findings

- The shared player still had a few layout/polish issues once surrounding containers were hardened:
  - compact mode assumed a one-line icon + timestamp row with no explicit `min-w-0 max-w-full` contract, so it relied on the parent card rather than declaring its own narrow-width behavior
  - compact mode showed no wrap-safe status copy before audio existed, which made the control feel icon-only and harder to parse in dense session footers
  - the full-size variant still used a rigid single-row control layout, so the scrubber/timestamps and mute/volume controls had limited room to reflow when width or zoom tightened
  - the control buttons/sliders lacked explicit accessibility labels, which is a quality issue on top of the visual polish pass
  - the compact error banners beside assistant-message/session-tile playback controls still assumed short provider errors and did not consistently opt into `min-w-0` containment

#### Changes made

- Refined compact audio-player chrome in `audio-player.tsx`:
  - added `min-w-0 max-w-full flex-wrap` containment plus a subtle rounded background so the player behaves like a self-contained compact control rather than a loose inline row
  - kept the play/generate button `shrink-0`
  - added a flexible status/time label that shows `Generate audio`, `Generating audio…`, `Loading audio…`, or the current/duration timestamp in a wrap-safe way depending on state
  - marked the compact status text as `aria-live="polite"` so non-visual users get the same state changes
- Hardened the full-size player variant:
  - made the overall control row wrap-safe with explicit `min-w-0 max-w-full`
  - kept the primary play button `shrink-0`, the scrubber column `min-w-0 flex-1`, and the volume row bounded with `min-w-0 max-w-full`
  - switched the timestamp row to a wrap-safe layout and widened the volume slider into a bounded flexible control instead of a tiny fixed-width strip
  - added explicit `aria-label` / `title` text for play/pause, mute/unmute, position, and volume controls
- Tightened the desktop TTS call sites in `agent-progress.tsx` and `session-tile.tsx`:
  - changed the playback/error wrapper to `min-w-0 space-y-1`
  - updated the red error banners to `break-words` / `overflow-wrap:anywhere` so long provider/network failures stay inside the tile/message width
- Added `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/audio-player.layout.test.ts` and extended `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts` so this shared component and its downstream compact error chrome now have direct regression coverage.

#### Verification

- Targeted test: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/components/audio-player.layout.test.ts src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts`
- Targeted web typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck:web`

#### Notes

- This chunk stays desktop/shared-component scoped: mobile has adjacent response-history speak affordances, but not the same reusable `AudioPlayer` control.
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: mobile `ResponseHistoryPanel` header/timestamp/speak rows now stand out as the next unclaimed playback-adjacent surface to harden for narrow widths and larger text sizes.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 19: Retry banner and message-queue footer chrome under narrow widths / zoom

- Area selected:
  - `RetryStatusBanner` in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tsx`
  - `MessageQueuePanel` in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/message-queue-panel.tsx`
- Why this chunk: after chunks 17 and 18 tightened the approval and mid-turn response cards, the next most fragile sessions-area surface was the compact status/queue chrome that sits in or near the tile footer. These rows combine status copy, badges, timers, and multiple small actions, which makes them especially likely to clip or collapse badly under narrow tiles and font zoom.
- Audit method:
  - inspected the inline retry banner implementation in `agent-progress.tsx`
  - inspected both compact and expanded queue treatments in `message-queue-panel.tsx`
  - focused specifically on header/action rows, compact queue controls, paused notices, and per-item action pressure in queued-message rows

#### Findings

- The retry banner still had several one-line assumptions similar to the pre-fix approval card:
  - reason text, spinner, attempt text, and countdown badge were arranged as if plenty of width were always available
  - the content row used `justify-between`, which is efficient at medium widths but brittle when badges or zoom consume more space
- The queue panel was a stronger improvement target than the remaining audio chrome because it had multiple related narrow-width issues in one surface:
  - compact mode kept the count and actions on a single line with no explicit `min-w-0` / wrap-safe grouping
  - expanded header actions (`Pause` / `Resume`, `Clear All`, collapse) could easily crowd the title on small tiles
  - paused notice copy did not explicitly protect long wrapping
  - queued-message rows used a no-wrap action cluster that could crowd the message preview/meta row

#### Changes made

- Refined the retry banner in `agent-progress.tsx`:
  - added `min-w-0 max-w-full` containment
  - made the amber header wrap-safe with `shrink-0` icon/spinner handling and `min-w-0 flex-1` for the reason text
  - converted the attempt/countdown row from `justify-between` to a wrap-safe flex row
  - ensured the explanatory copy can break long words cleanly
- Refined `message-queue-panel.tsx` in both compact and expanded modes:
  - compact queue row now wraps safely, gives the count label a `min-w-0 flex-1` lane, and groups the small action icons in a separate trailing cluster
  - expanded queue header now wraps title and actions instead of assuming a single line
  - paused notice now explicitly supports word-wrapping
  - queued-message rows now allow action controls to wrap/reflow more gracefully beside long message previews and metadata
  - edit-mode action buttons also wrap instead of assuming a fixed-width footer row
- Extended `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts` again so the layout contract now covers retry banners plus both compact and expanded queue-panel chrome.

#### Verification

- Targeted test: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts --reporter=dot`
- Targeted web typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck:web --pretty false`

#### Notes

- At this point the major non-markdown sessions chrome immediately above/below message content has been covered by three consecutive audit chunks:
  - tool approval
  - mid-turn response/history
  - retry + queue footer/status rows
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: a compact audio/status-controls pass (especially inline audio-player/error states and any remaining narrow action rows near follow-up inputs), or a fresh move out of sessions chrome into another top-level desktop surface that has not yet been audited.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 18: Mid-turn response bubble and past-response history under narrow widths / zoom

- Area selected: desktop `MidTurnUserResponseBubble` / `PastResponseItem` in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tsx`, plus the mobile `apps/mobile/src/ui/ResponseHistoryPanel.tsx` history surface
- Why this chunk: after chunk 17 fixed the adjacent inline tool-approval card, the next most constrained sessions surface in the same area was the green `respond_to_user` / mid-turn response bubble and its expandable past-response history. It sits directly beside markdown content, inline audio controls, and compact history chrome, so it is especially vulnerable to narrow tile widths and font zoom.
- Audit method:
  - reviewed `ui-audit.md` first to avoid overlap with the completed tool-approval pass
  - reused `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md` plus repo guidance/docs (`README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/AGENTS.md`) to stay aligned with the Electron-first renderer/mobile split
  - kept the desktop app running via `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9373 ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS="--inspect=9379" pnpm dev -- -d`
  - inspected the concrete `MidTurnUserResponseBubble`, `PastResponseItem`, audio-error, and tile/overlay call sites in `agent-progress.tsx`
  - cross-checked the mobile `ResponseHistoryPanel` header/history layout for the same narrow-width and large-text pressure

#### Findings

- The green mid-turn response/history stack was the next weakest sessions surface adjacent to rendered content:
  - the outer mid-turn bubble did not explicitly opt into `min-w-0 max-w-full`, so it still depended on parent containment instead of declaring its own narrow-width contract
  - the header icon / live-TTS control chrome was not fully protected as non-shrinking trailing UI, so it could compete with the title/preview block under tighter widths and zoom
  - the inline TTS error treatment did not force long provider/network error strings to break cleanly
  - the `Past Responses (n)` heading kept the count embedded in one uppercase string instead of a wrap-safe badge treatment
  - collapsed `PastResponseItem` rows still needed stronger `min-w-0` containment around the preview slot so long text would not crowd the chevron/index chrome
- Mobile had the same class of polish issue in a different layout system:
  - `ResponseHistoryPanel` assumed a mostly single-line header and timestamp/action row, which could crowd the title badge, chevron, and speak affordance under narrow widths or larger text sizes

#### Changes made

- Hardened the desktop mid-turn response bubble in `agent-progress.tsx`:
  - added `min-w-0 max-w-full` containment on the outer green card
  - made the header explicitly `min-w-0 flex-wrap`, kept the message icon `shrink-0`, and anchored the live TTS pause button to the top edge for better small-width stability
  - added `min-w-0` containment to the expanded content/audio wrapper so the bubble behaves like the other audited session cards
  - updated the inline TTS error box to `break-words` / `overflow-wrap:anywhere` for long error payloads
- Reworked the desktop past-response history chrome for better zoom resilience:
  - split `Past Responses (n)` into a wrap-safe label plus compact count badge
  - tightened `PastResponseItem` rows with `min-w-0` containment and a flexible preview slot so long previews do not crowd the chevron/index chrome
  - kept the expanded markdown/audio content inside an explicit `min-w-0` container
- Polished the mobile `ResponseHistoryPanel` to match the same intent:
  - made the header left side flexible/wrapping with `minWidth: 0` + `flexShrink`
  - protected the badge/chevron as non-shrinking trailing chrome
  - allowed response timestamp/speak rows to wrap cleanly with gap spacing instead of depending on a strict single line
- Extended `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts` so the responsive class contract now also covers the mid-turn response/history surface.

#### Verification

- Targeted test: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts`
- Targeted web typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck:web`
- Targeted mobile typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/mobile exec tsc --noEmit`

#### Notes

- The renderer automation target still only exposed the shell document rather than hydrated app DOM, so this chunk relied on the documented debug-launch path plus direct inspection of the concrete renderer/mobile implementations.
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: the shared compact audio/TTS chrome (`AudioPlayer` and adjacent playback/error controls) now stands out as the next best uninvestigated surface across desktop session bubbles and mobile response history when windows/text scale down and up.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 17: Inline tool approval card under narrow tile / overlay widths and zoom

- Area selected: desktop inline tool approval card in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tsx`
- Why this chunk: chunk 16 explicitly left the non-markdown sessions chrome adjacent to rendered content as the next best follow-up. The highest-value remaining hotspot in that area was the fixed-position `ToolApprovalBubble`, which appears in the most constrained desktop contexts (sessions tiles and overlay footer area) and still had several one-line layout assumptions.
- Audit method:
  - reviewed `ui-audit.md` first to avoid overlap with prior sessions/markdown passes
  - reviewed `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md` plus repo guidance/docs (`README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/AGENTS.md`)
  - launched the desktop app with remote debugging enabled via `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9363 ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS="--inspect=9369" pnpm dev -- -d`
  - inspected the concrete `ToolApprovalBubble` implementation and its tile/overlay call sites in `agent-progress.tsx`
  - cross-checked `apps/mobile/src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx`; mobile has respond-to-user history and tool execution UI, but no equivalent inline tool-approval card, so no mobile change was needed for this chunk

#### Findings

- The approval card was still one of the weakest narrow-width / high-zoom surfaces in the sessions stack:
  - the amber header row did not wrap, so the title and processing spinner competed for one line
  - the `Tool:` row had no `min-w-0` / truncation contract around the tool-name code pill
  - the always-visible arguments preview was a single truncated line, which hid useful context while still not giving the card a clear preview container
  - the `Deny` / `Approve` buttons embedded their hotkey chips inline, forcing too much horizontal content into one row for tight tiles
- This was primarily a **layout-and-polish** issue rather than a functional bug, but it was the clearest remaining sessions pressure point adjacent to message content after the previous markdown/session-card chunks.

#### Changes made

- Reworked `ToolApprovalBubble` in `agent-progress.tsx` to behave better in narrow tiles and overlay-width states:
  - added `min-w-0 max-w-full` containment on the card
  - made the header wrap and protected the shield/spinner as `shrink-0`
  - changed the tool row to wrap cleanly and capped the tool-name code pill with `max-w-full min-w-0 truncate`
- Improved preview/readability without expanding the card too aggressively:
  - replaced the bare truncated arguments line with a lightweight bordered preview block
  - used `line-clamp-2`, `break-words`, and `overflow-wrap:anywhere` so long argument summaries stay readable without forcing overflow
  - updated the expanded `pre` block to respect `max-w-full` and wrap long tokens more gracefully
- Simplified the action area for better zoom resilience:
  - converted the action row to wrapping equal-width buttons
  - moved the hotkey hints out of the buttons into a separate wrap-safe metadata row
  - kept the existing keyboard shortcuts/titles intact while reducing horizontal button pressure
- Extended `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts` so the responsive class contract now also covers inline tool-approval card treatment.

#### Verification

- Targeted test: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts`
- Targeted web typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck:web`

#### Notes

- Electron-native inspection again attached to the shell document with an empty `#root`, so this chunk combined the documented debug startup path with direct inspection of the concrete approval-card implementation rather than hydrated DOM automation.
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: the adjacent `MidTurnUserResponseBubble` / past-response history stack in `agent-progress.tsx`, especially the expanded history section and audio-player/error chrome under tight tile widths and zoom.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 16: Shared markdown renderer long links / code / tables under narrow widths and zoom

- Area selected: desktop shared markdown rendering in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/markdown-renderer.tsx`
- Why this chunk: chunk 15 explicitly left rendered markdown as the next best sessions follow-up. The highest-value remaining hotspot was the shared markdown renderer used in session messages and adjacent summary surfaces, especially for long inline code/links, fenced code blocks, tables, and the separate `<think>` rendering path.
- Audit method:
  - reviewed `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md`
  - reviewed repo guidance/docs (`README.md`, `DEVELOPMENT.md`, and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/AGENTS.md`) to keep the pass aligned with the Electron-first desktop renderer and the required mobile cross-check
  - launched the desktop app with remote debugging enabled via `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9363 ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS="--inspect=9369" pnpm dev -- -d`
  - inspected the shared renderer implementation in `markdown-renderer.tsx` plus its session call sites in `agent-progress.tsx` / `session-tile.tsx`
  - cross-checked `apps/mobile/src/ui/MarkdownRenderer.tsx`; mobile uses a separate React Native markdown renderer and does not share the desktop `<think>` path, so no matching mobile change was required for this chunk

#### Findings

- The shared desktop markdown renderer still had a few compressed-width / high-zoom weak points:
  - long markdown links used a plain underlined anchor style with no explicit overflow handling, so URL-heavy content could force awkward wrapping or horizontal pressure in narrow session tiles
  - inline code relied on default word-breaking behavior, which is brittle for long paths, commands, hashes, or provider/model identifiers embedded in prose
  - fenced code blocks effectively styled both `pre` and block `code`, which is visually heavier than necessary and makes the block chrome feel denser than the rest of the sessions surface
  - GFM tables had horizontal scrolling but not a stronger outer chrome / cell wrapping treatment for long values
- The most important consistency issue was in the `<think>` path:
  - normal markdown content had custom code/table rendering, but think sections only reused links/images
  - that meant the same content type could render with different density and overflow behavior depending on whether it appeared in the visible answer or inside the expandable thinking section

#### Changes made

- Hardened shared markdown chrome in `markdown-renderer.tsx` so the same overflow-safe treatment now applies everywhere the shared renderer is used:
  - long links now explicitly use `break-words` + `overflow-wrap:anywhere`
  - inline code now wraps more gracefully instead of depending on default token behavior
  - fenced code blocks now use a single outer `pre` shell with `max-w-full overflow-x-auto`, lighter neutral surface styling, and simpler inner block-code typography
  - table wrappers now use rounded bordered horizontal-scroll containers with better cell alignment/wrapping for long values
- Extended `sharedMarkdownComponents` so think sections inherit the same code/pre/table handling instead of falling back to looser default prose rendering.
- Polished list readability in the main markdown flow by switching the custom desktop lists from `list-inside` to `list-outside` with explicit left padding and break handling on list items.
- Added focused regression coverage in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/markdown-renderer.layout.test.ts` for the responsive/overflow-safe class contract.

#### Verification

- Targeted test: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/components/markdown-renderer.layout.test.ts`
- Targeted web typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck:web`

#### Notes

- Electron-native inspection again attached to the shell document with an empty `#root`, so this chunk used the documented debug startup path plus direct inspection of the shared renderer implementation and call sites rather than relying on hydrated DOM automation.
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: audit the non-markdown session chrome directly adjacent to rendered content (especially the inline tool-approval / mid-turn response cards) for narrow-tile and zoom pressure now that the markdown content itself is more resilient.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 15: Sessions summary cards in narrow tiles / zoom

- Area selected: desktop sessions summary tab cards inside `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-summary-view.tsx`
- Why this chunk: chunk 14 explicitly left the sessions summary/markdown content as the next best follow-up. The highest-value remaining hotspot in the current code was the summary card chrome itself: toggle affordance, metadata row, save action, and the expanded detail gutter when a tile is near the sessions grid minimum width or text is zoomed.
- Audit method:
  - reviewed `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md`
  - launched the desktop app with remote debugging enabled via `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9353 ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS="--inspect=9359" pnpm dev -- -d`
  - inspected the summary-tab call sites in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tsx` and the full summary-card implementation in `agent-summary-view.tsx`
  - cross-checked `apps/mobile/src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx` and `apps/mobile/src/ui/MarkdownRenderer.tsx`; mobile renders chat markdown but does not have an equivalent step-summary card view, so no parallel mobile change was required for this chunk

#### Findings

- The summary cards still had a narrow-width / high-zoom pressure point in their header chrome:
  - the card header packed the chevron affordance, metadata row, two-line action summary, and `Save` button into one non-wrapping row
  - the toggle affordance was a separate tiny button inside a larger clickable header region, which made the interaction feel less polished than the rest of the sessions surface
- The expanded summary content also gave up too much horizontal room inside tiles:
  - the `ml-7` detail gutter was generous for wide layouts but expensive in a `200px`-class tile
  - finding/decision bullets did not explicitly protect their markers from shrinking, and long text/tags relied on default wrapping rather than explicit width containment
- The summary-specific highlight cards were also still a bit rigid for compressed widths:
  - `Important Findings (...)` kept the count in the heading text instead of a compact badge
  - `Latest Activity` did not explicitly protect long action text with a more forgiving wrapped treatment

#### Changes made

- Reworked `SummaryCard` header chrome in `agent-summary-view.tsx` so it behaves better at narrow widths and under zoom:
  - replaced the loose clickable `div` + inner chevron button pattern with a single flexing toggle button region and a sibling save action
  - added a wrapping outer header row plus `min-w-0 flex-1` on the toggle region
  - let the metadata row wrap cleanly and kept the save action aligned with `ml-auto shrink-0`
- Reduced summary detail density pressure without redesigning the component:
  - trimmed the expanded gutter from the old `ml-7` treatment to a smaller responsive indent
  - added explicit `break-words` / `min-w-0 flex-1` handling for long findings, decisions, next steps, and tags
  - kept bullets/checkmarks `shrink-0` so markers stay visually stable at zoomed text sizes
- Polished the summary-tab highlight cards:
  - split the `Important Findings` count into a compact badge so the title wraps more gracefully
  - made the descriptive copy and sticky `Latest Activity` content explicitly wrap/break words instead of relying on default flow
- Added focused regression coverage in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-summary-view.layout.test.ts` for the responsive/accessibility class contract.

#### Verification

- Targeted test: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/components/agent-summary-view.layout.test.ts`
- Targeted web typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck:web`

#### Notes

- Electron-native renderer automation again attached to the shell document instead of the hydrated React tree for this sessions surface, so this chunk combined the documented app startup path with direct inspection of the concrete summary-card implementation.
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: a similarly focused pass on `markdown-renderer.tsx` itself for long inline code/links, tables, and think-section density inside session messages at high zoom.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 14: Sessions tile expanded tool output blocks at narrow widths / zoom

- Area selected: desktop sessions tile expanded tool detail/output blocks inside `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tsx`
- Why this chunk: chunk 13 covered the compact tool execution row chrome and explicitly left the next best follow-up as the message stream’s markdown/code-block density. The most actionable remaining hotspot was the expanded tool output area itself: parameter/result headers, indented detail gutters, and long `pre` blocks under zoom.
- Audit method:
  - reviewed `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md`
  - launched the desktop app with remote debugging enabled via `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9343 ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS="--inspect=9349" pnpm dev -- -d`
  - inspected the expanded tool-detail paths in `agent-progress.tsx` (`ToolExecutionBubble`, `AssistantWithToolsBubble`, and `CompactMessage` fallback tool/result cards)
  - cross-checked `apps/mobile/src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx`; mobile’s equivalent tool-output surface does not share the tile-width gutter pressure from the desktop sessions grid, so no matching mobile change was required for this chunk

#### Findings

- After chunk 13, the compact tool rows were in better shape, but the expanded tool output blocks still had layout pressure in narrow tiles and at high zoom:
  - `Parameters` / `Copy` and `Result` / char-count headers still depended on tight single-line layouts in `ToolExecutionBubble`
  - the shared `AssistantWithToolsBubble` detail area still used a deeper left gutter plus rigid `pre` blocks
  - fallback `CompactMessage` tool result cards still used `break-all`, which is harsh on readability for long command output, stack traces, and JSON-ish content
- The issue here was less about top-level tile responsiveness and more about **readability density** inside constrained message content:
  - long tool output should scroll horizontally when needed, but not force ugly mid-token splitting everywhere
  - detail chrome should wrap before pushing copy affordances or char counts into cramped edge states

#### Changes made

- Updated expanded tool-detail containers in `agent-progress.tsx` to be more forgiving in narrow tiles:
  - reduced the left indent from `ml-4` to `ml-3` in the two shared expanded detail gutters
  - made the `Parameters` / `Copy` and `Result` / char-count rows explicitly wrap with `justify-between gap-1.5`
  - slightly increased the compact `Copy` button height/padding so it remains easier to hit/read under zoom
- Updated expanded tool output/code blocks to respect available width without the previous overly aggressive wrapping:
  - replaced `overflow-auto` with explicit `overflow-x-auto overflow-y-auto`
  - added `max-w-full` to the relevant `pre` blocks
  - changed the expanded result/error blocks from `break-all` to `break-words` so long content stays more legible while still preventing runaway overflow
- Extended `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts` so the responsive class contract now also covers the expanded tool-detail chrome/output block treatment.

#### Verification

- Targeted test: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts`
- Targeted web typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck:web`

#### Notes

- Electron-native renderer automation again attached to the shell document instead of the hydrated React tree for this surface, so this chunk used documented app startup plus direct inspection of the concrete implementation hotspots.
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: a focused pass on rendered markdown inside session messages and summaries (`markdown-renderer.tsx`, tables/images/code fences, and `AgentSummaryView`) for high-zoom density, especially where prose content mixes with cards inside the same tile.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 13: Sessions tile message-stream tool execution rows at narrow widths / zoom

- Area selected: desktop sessions tile chat/message stream tool execution rows inside `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tsx`
- Why this chunk: chunk 12 intentionally stopped after the tile body control chrome. The next highest-value, not-yet-audited hotspot inside the same surface was the message stream itself—especially the compact tool execution rows and their expanded detail headers once tiles compress toward the sessions grid minimum width.
- Audit method:
  - reviewed `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md`
  - launched the desktop app with remote debugging enabled via `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9343 ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS="--inspect=9349" pnpm dev -- -d`
  - inspected the shared message-stream tool execution code paths in `agent-progress.tsx` (`ToolExecutionBubble`, `AssistantWithToolsBubble`, and the fallback expanded tool/result cards inside `CompactMessage`)
  - cross-checked `apps/mobile/src/screens/ChatScreen.tsx`; mobile already uses `numberOfLines={1}`, `flexShrink: 1`, and device-independent font sizing for its equivalent compact tool rows, so no matching mobile change was needed

#### Findings

- The sessions tile message stream still had several compact tool execution rows that could crowd or clip once the tile narrows or font zoom increases:
  - standalone `ToolExecutionBubble` rows
  - unified `AssistantWithToolsBubble` rows
- In both row types, the primary tool label / execute-command text relied on `truncate` without the surrounding `min-w-0` / shrink contract needed for very narrow flex layouts, which risks pushing the status icon, result preview, or chevron into a cramped edge state.
- The expanded detail headers under those rows also used single-line `justify-between` layouts for:
  - `Parameters` + `Copy`
  - `Result` / `Error` + char count
- The fallback expanded tool/result cards in `CompactMessage` had the same header issue: long tool names, count badges, and char counts all shared rigid one-line header rows.

#### Changes made

- Updated the standalone and unified tool execution rows in `agent-progress.tsx` to behave better inside narrow sessions tiles:
  - added `min-w-0` to the outer row
  - changed tool/command labels to `min-w-0 shrink truncate`
  - made status icons `shrink-0`
  - made result previews `min-w-0 flex-1 truncate`
- Updated the expanded tool detail headers to wrap cleanly under zoomed text:
  - `flex-wrap` on `Parameters` / `Copy` and `Result` / char-count rows
  - `ml-auto shrink-0` on the copy button and char count so controls stay readable
- Updated the fallback `CompactMessage` tool call / result headers to wrap and truncate instead of leaking width pressure into the tile.
- Extended `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts` so the responsive class contract now also covers message-stream tool execution rows.

#### Verification

- Targeted test: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts`
- Targeted web typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.web.json --composite false`

#### Notes

- As in earlier sessions chunks, Electron-native renderer automation attached to a shell document rather than the hydrated React tree for this surface, so the audit relied on documented live app startup plus direct inspection of the concrete tile message-stream layout code.
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: a focused pass on markdown/code-block density inside the sessions tile message stream (large fenced blocks, tables, and long inline code) at high zoom, now that the tool execution row chrome itself is more resilient.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 12: Sessions tile body controls at narrow widths / zoom

- Area selected: desktop sessions tile body controls inside `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tsx`
- Why this chunk: chunk 11 intentionally stopped at tile chrome and explicitly left the tile body itself as the next follow-up, especially the message/summary controls under the grid's `200px` minimum width and increased font scaling.
- Audit method:
  - reviewed `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md`
  - launched the desktop app with remote debugging enabled via `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9343 ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS="--inspect=9349" pnpm dev -- -d`
  - inspected the tile-body code paths for the chat/summary switcher and delegated-subagent conversation preview inside `agent-progress.tsx`
  - cross-checked `apps/mobile/src/` for an equivalent chat/summary or delegation surface; no matching mobile UI needed the same change

#### Findings

- The sessions tile body still had two non-wrapping control rows that were likely to crowd or clip at narrow tile widths and under zoomed text:
  - the `Chat` / `Summary` tab switcher shown when step summaries exist
  - the delegated-subagent `Recent activity` / collapsed preview header
- Both rows packed icons, labels, badges, and actions into single-line inline layouts without enough wrapping/truncation protection:
  - the tab buttons used plain inline labels plus a summary-count badge
  - the delegated preview label did not truncate, so a longer preview string could push the copy/expand controls into a cramped edge state
- This was more of a body-content polish issue than a page-level structural bug, but it was the most obvious remaining sessions hotspot after the earlier header/footer chrome fixes.

#### Changes made

- Updated both tile-body chat/summary switcher rows in `agent-progress.tsx` to use wrapping control chrome:
  - `flex-wrap` on the row container
  - `min-w-0 max-w-full` on the tab buttons
  - truncating text spans for `Chat` / `Summary`
  - `shrink-0` summary-count badge so the count remains readable when space is tight
- Updated the delegated-subagent conversation preview header to behave better in compressed tiles:
  - wrapping outer row
  - `min-w-0 flex-1 truncate` on the preview text
  - `shrink-0` conversation-count badge
  - preserved right-side copy/expand controls with `ml-auto flex-shrink-0`
- Extended the focused regression coverage in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts` so the responsive class contract now also covers the tile-body controls.

#### Verification

- Targeted test: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts`
- Targeted web typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck:web`

#### Notes

- As with chunk 11, Electron renderer automation did not give a stable hydrated DOM for this surface, so the audit used live app startup plus direct inspection of the concrete narrow-width layout code paths.
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: a live pass on the sessions tile message stream itself (tool output blocks, markdown bubbles, and summary cards) at high zoom, since the body control chrome is now covered.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 9: Panel waveform footer at narrow widths / zoom

- Area selected: desktop floating panel recording state (`apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/panel.tsx`)
- Why this chunk: prior audit log had already code-reviewed the renderer broadly and explicitly left a follow-up to visually verify the waveform panel at minimum width.
- Audit method:
  - reviewed `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md`
  - launched desktop app with remote debugging enabled via `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9333 ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS="--inspect=9339" pnpm dev -- -d`
  - inspected panel implementation and remaining narrow-width/zoom-sensitive UI in code
  - checked mobile chat composer for an equivalent issue; no matching recording footer pattern needed the same change

#### Findings

- The recording footer under the waveform used a single non-wrapping horizontal row for:
  - the `Submit` button
  - the keyboard hint (`or press ...` / `or Release keys`)
- At the panel minimum width and especially under increased font scaling, that row had a clear risk of:
  - overflow/clipping
  - awkward centering
  - truncated or wrapped keyboard hints pushing the button out of balance
- The selected-agent and continue-conversation badges also used fixed inner max widths instead of capping the badge relative to the panel viewport.

#### Changes made

- Updated the recording-state badges to respect the available viewport width with `max-w-[calc(100%-2rem)]` and `min-w-0 truncate` text.
- Updated the recording footer row to:
  - wrap when space is tight
  - stay centered
  - preserve button size while allowing hint text to reflow cleanly
  - keep keyboard hints visually readable at zoomed text sizes
- Added a focused regression test for the responsive class contract:
  - `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/panel.recording-layout.test.ts`

#### Verification

- Targeted test: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/pages/panel.recording-layout.test.ts`
- Typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec tsc --noEmit`

#### Notes

- Electron renderer automation for this panel surface was unstable after route switching, so this chunk relied on a combination of live app startup verification plus direct implementation audit of the remaining layout hotspot.
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: live visual pass on the sessions page at very narrow main-window widths and increased zoom, since the floating panel footer hotspot is now covered.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 10: Floating panel compact-width breathing room

- Area selected: desktop floating recording panel width floor (`apps/desktop/src/main/window.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/panel.tsx`)
- Why this chunk: after the footer-wrap follow-up, a live visual pass still showed the compact floating panel reading as horizontally cramped at its minimum/default recording width.
- Audit method:
  - reviewed `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md`
  - launched the desktop app with remote debugging enabled via `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9333 ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS="--inspect=9339" pnpm dev -- -d`
  - visually inspected the floating recording panel before and after the sizing change
  - checked the main-process window sizing logic and the renderer-side mirrored min-width constant
  - cross-checked mobile impact: no equivalent Electron floating panel surface exists in `apps/mobile`, so no mobile change was needed

#### Findings

- The compact recording panel minimum width was still effectively driven by the raw waveform bar math (`~312px` for 70 bars + gaps + padding).
- That raw waveform width avoided bar clipping, but it left the panel feeling visually cramped once the recording badge, waveform lane, and submit hint shared the same narrow surface.
- Live inspection confirmed the issue was more about design polish and breathing room than outright overflow: the panel read like a tight status pill instead of a comfortable voice/listening surface.

#### Changes made

- Added a `360px` minimum content-width floor in `apps/desktop/src/main/window.ts` so the panel window no longer bottoms out at the raw waveform math alone.
- Kept the renderer-side `MIN_WAVEFORM_WIDTH` logic aligned with the same `360px` floor in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/panel.tsx`.
- Extended the focused panel regression test in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/panel.recording-layout.test.ts` to assert the compact-width floor contract in both the renderer and main-process sources.

#### Verification

- Live visual re-check of the running app: the compact recording panel now has noticeably better horizontal breathing room with no obvious clipping, truncation, or spacing regressions.
- Targeted test: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/pages/panel.recording-layout.test.ts`
- Desktop typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck` still fails due broad pre-existing React/JSX typing issues across unrelated files (`App.tsx`, many `lucide-react` usages, `Toaster`, QR code components, multiple settings pages). No failure pointed at the files changed in this chunk.

#### Notes

- This is a conservative polish fix: it improves the default/minimum footprint without redesigning the panel layout.
- Best next UI audit chunk after this one: live visual pass on the sessions page at very narrow main-window widths and increased zoom.

### 2026-03-06 — Chunk 11: Sessions tile chrome under narrow widths / zoom

- Area selected: desktop sessions tile header/footer metadata chrome (`apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tsx`, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/acp-session-badge.tsx`)
- Why this chunk: earlier sessions work fixed the page-level header and empty state, but the next highest-pressure hotspot was still inside individual session tiles once the grid compresses toward its `200px` minimum width.
- Audit method:
  - reviewed `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md`
  - launched the desktop app with remote debugging enabled via `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9333 ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS="--inspect=9339" pnpm dev -- -d`
  - inspected the sessions tile layout code paths and grid min-width constraints (`session-grid.tsx`, `use-resizable.ts`)
  - checked `apps/mobile/src/` for an equivalent ACP/tile session surface; no matching mobile UI needed the same change

#### Findings

- The sessions grid can compress tiles down to `200px` wide, which leaves very little room for the tile header chrome once the row contains:
  - status icon
  - title + agent label
  - approval badge
  - 3–4 icon buttons
- The tile footer metadata row was still a single non-wrapping flex line. With ACP sessions, the combination of profile label + ACP badges + context bar + step/status text could overflow, clip, or visually crowd under increased font zoom.
- `ACPSessionBadge` itself did not cap or truncate its inner badge labels to the available width, so long ACP agent/model labels could dominate a narrow tile.

#### Changes made

- Reworked the tile header in `agent-progress.tsx` to use a wrapping layout:
  - left title block stays `min-w-0`
  - right-side approval/actions cluster can wrap instead of forcing horizontal overflow
  - icon buttons are explicitly `shrink-0`
- Reworked the tile footer metadata row to wrap cleanly while keeping the trailing `Step …` / completion status visible via `whitespace-nowrap`.
- Updated `ACPSessionBadge` to:
  - respect parent width with `max-w-full min-w-0`
  - allow badge wrapping at the container level
  - truncate long ACP labels inside each badge instead of leaking width pressure into the tile
- Added a focused regression test for the responsive class contract:
  - `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts`

#### Verification

- Targeted test: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec vitest run src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tile-layout.test.ts`
- Targeted web typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop exec tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.web.json --composite false`

#### Notes

- Electron renderer automation again attached to a shell document instead of the hydrated React tree for this surface, so this chunk relied on live app startup plus direct implementation audit of the narrow-width tile hotspot.
- This chunk is intentionally scoped to the sessions tile chrome only; the next good follow-up would be a live pass on sessions content density within the tile body itself (message stream, summary tab, and follow-up input) at increased zoom.

- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/settings-models.tsx` — stub (returns null), no issues

### Issues found

**agent-summary-view.tsx — SummaryCard header accessibility + metadata row wrap**
- Lines 102–113: The card header was a `div` with `onClick` that contained a nested `button` (the chevron) and a sibling `Button` (Save). Using a `div` as an interactive element is an accessibility violation:
  - Screen readers won't announce it as a button/interactive region.
  - There is no keyboard handler on the outer `div` — users navigating via keyboard can only focus the inner chevron `button`, but clicking it focuses the inner button, not the outer "row" toggle. Pressing Tab lands on the nested buttons, but pressing Enter/Space on the row div itself does nothing.
- The `flex items-center gap-2 mb-1` row on line 113 contained time + step + `ImportanceBadge` with no `flex-wrap`. At narrow card widths (< 320px), the three items could overflow.

**message-queue-panel.tsx — header overflow (full panel mode)**
- Lines 378–399: The header flex row `flex items-center justify-between` had no layout protection:
  - Left side `div.flex.items-center.gap-2` had no `min-w-0` or `flex-1` — at narrow widths, the label "Queued Messages (10)" could push the right-side action buttons off screen.
  - Icon (Clock/Pause) had no `shrink-0` — could be compressed at very narrow widths.
  - Title `span` had no `truncate` — long text (many queued messages) could overflow.
  - Right side `div.flex.items-center.gap-1` had no `shrink-0` — could be compressed.

**message-queue-panel.tsx — compact mode (used in tile follow-up area)**
- Lines 306–323: Icon lacked `shrink-0`; status text span lacked `truncate min-w-0 flex-1` — at very narrow tiles the text could overflow the badge container.

**session-input.tsx — right-side "Start a new agent session" text**
- Lines 171–179 (default/collapsed mode): The right-side container `div.flex.items-center.gap-2` had no `min-w-0`. The "Start a new agent session" text `div.text-sm.text-muted-foreground` had no `truncate` or `min-w-0`. At narrow windows the text could push the `AgentSelector` off screen or overflow.

### Cleared as clean (no changes needed)
- `past-sessions-dialog.tsx`: Dialog correctly sized with `max-w-sm w-[calc(100%-2rem)]`. Session rows use `min-w-0 flex-1 overflow-hidden` + `truncate`. Timestamp/delete toggle pattern correct.
- `active-agents-sidebar.tsx`: Good use of `truncate`, `min-w-0`, `shrink-0` throughout.
- `app-layout.tsx`: `scrollbar-none` confirmed defined in `css/tailwind.css`. Sidebar is correct. `scrollbar-none` on the expanded sidebar scroll container is valid.
- `markdown-renderer.tsx`: `ThinkSection` button is `w-full` so it can't overflow its container. Image uses `max-h-[28rem] w-full object-contain` — correct. Code blocks have `overflow-x-auto`.
- `agent-processing-view.tsx`: Kill confirmation `max-w-sm mx-4` acceptable. `pointer-events-none` on overlay spinner is correct.
- `tile-follow-up-input.tsx`: Button row with `flex-1` input + 5 icon buttons is fine at minimum tile widths. Agent name indicator already at `text-[10px]`.
- `tool-execution-stats.tsx`: Compact mode `inline-flex` is constrained by parent context; no overflow.
- `settings-models.tsx`: Stub file (`return null`).

### Changes made

**agent-summary-view.tsx**
- Changed outer `div` to `div` with `role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`, `onKeyDown` handler for Enter/Space, and `aria-expanded={isExpanded}`.
- Changed inner chevron from `button` element to `span` with `aria-hidden="true"` — the outer div is now the semantic interactive element; the inner span is purely decorative.
- Changed `flex items-center gap-2 mb-1` → `flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2 mb-1` on the metadata row.

**message-queue-panel.tsx (full panel mode header)**
- Added `gap-2` to outer header flex container.
- Changed left `div.flex.items-center.gap-2` → `div.flex.min-w-0.flex-1.items-center.gap-2`.
- Added `shrink-0` to Clock and Pause icons.
- Changed title `span` to add `truncate` class.
- Changed right `div.flex.items-center.gap-1` → `div.flex.shrink-0.items-center.gap-1`.

**message-queue-panel.tsx (compact mode)**
- Added `shrink-0` to Clock and Pause icons.
- Changed status text span to add `truncate min-w-0 flex-1`.

**session-input.tsx**
- Changed right-side container to `div.flex.min-w-0.items-center.gap-2`.
- Changed "Start a new agent session" from `div` to `span.truncate.text-sm.text-muted-foreground`.

### Verified not broken
- TypeScript typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck` → exit 0.

### Coverage summary — all renderer files reviewed
After 9 chunks, every renderer component and page has been reviewed:
- All `text-[9px]`/`text-[8px]` occurrences eliminated (chunk 4–8).
- All major flex rows lacking `flex-wrap`, `min-w-0`, or `shrink-0` in settings, sessions, onboarding, memories, panel, agent-progress, sidebar, dialogs, and queue components have been fixed.
- Accessibility: SummaryCard header now has proper keyboard support.

## 2026-03-06 — chunk 8: global text-[9px] sweep + mcp-tools + capabilities + multi-agent + overflow-auto sweep

### Sources consulted
- Global grep: `text-[9px]`, `text-[8px]`, `text-[7px]` across all renderer `.tsx`/`.ts`
- Global grep: bare `overflow-auto` across all renderer `.tsx`/`.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/settings-mcp-tools.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/settings-capabilities.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/multi-agent-progress-view.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/memories.tsx`

### Issues found

**app-layout.tsx — sidebar nav badge straggler**
- Line 437: The notification badge on the Sessions nav link (showing active session count in collapsed sidebar mode) was `text-[9px]` — the last remaining sub-10px text after chunks 4–7.
- All other surfaces had already been raised to `text-[10px]` minimum.

**memories.tsx — bare overflow-auto on outer container**
- Line 419: Outer page container used `overflow-auto` (both axes) instead of `overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden`.
- Although the memories card grid uses constrained widths, a very long memory title or tag string could produce horizontal scroll, leaking content outside the panel. Chunk 3 fixed the header/filter row but missed the outer container declaration.

**settings-mcp-tools.tsx — already clean**
- Simple `MCPConfigManager` wrapper. Uses `overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden` and `min-w-0`. No issues.

**settings-capabilities.tsx — already clean**
- Two-tab wrapper. Tab bar is `flex items-center` with text labels (no overflow). Content uses `flex-1 min-h-0`. No issues.

**multi-agent-progress-view.tsx — already clean**
- Tab bar for multiple sessions uses `flex flex-1 gap-1 overflow-x-auto` for horizontal tab scroll, `max-w-[120px] truncate` on session titles, `shrink-0` on the hide-panel button. No overflow issues.

**`overflow-auto` sweep result**
- `ui/select.tsx`: inside SelectContent dropdown — correct for scrollable option list.
- `agent-progress.tsx`: multiple `pre` blocks with `overflow-auto` constrained by `max-h-*` — correct for code/output scroll.
- `mcp-config-manager.tsx`, `mcp-tool-manager.tsx`, `bundle-publish-dialog.tsx`: `pre` code preview blocks — correct.
- `memories.tsx:419`: **Fixed** (see above).

### Changes made

**app-layout.tsx**
- Line 437: `text-[9px]` → `text-[10px]` on the active-session count badge in the collapsed sidebar Sessions nav link.

**memories.tsx**
- Line 419: `overflow-auto` → `overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden` on the outer page container.

### Verified not broken
- TypeScript typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck` → exit 0.
- Global grep for `text-[9px]`, `text-[8px]`, `text-[7px]` across renderer: **zero results** — all sub-10px text has been eliminated.

### Summary: text-[9px] elimination complete
Across chunks 4–8, every occurrence of `text-[9px]` and the sole `text-[8px]` in the desktop renderer have been raised to a minimum of `text-[10px]`. Affected files:
- `agent-progress.tsx` (chunks 4 and 8): Copy button, char-count label, OK/ERR badge, Shift+Space/Space kbd elements, pre block explicit sizing
- `settings-skills.tsx` (chunk 4): header flex-wrap
- `agent-capabilities-sidebar.tsx` (chunk 5): Skills/MCP/Built-in count badges, server tool expand button, connection type badge (text-[8px]→text-[10px])
- `settings-agents.tsx` (chunk 7): all eight agent-card micro-badge types
- `app-layout.tsx` (chunk 8): Sessions nav badge

### Follow-up areas
- UI audit is now complete for all renderer pages and components reviewed. No further sub-10px text exists. Major layout/overflow issues have been fixed across settings, dialogs, sidebar, and panel.
- Consider a final visual review of the waveform panel at its minimum width (~312px) to confirm no clip/overflow on narrow screens.

## 2026-03-06 — chunk 7: settings-agents badge floor + setup + panel (panel all clear)

### Sources consulted
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/settings-agents.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/setup.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/panel.tsx`

### Issues found

**settings-agents.tsx — agent card micro-badge cluster**
- Lines 487–501 (`renderAgentList()`): every agent card showed 4–7 micro-badges (Built-in, Default, Disabled, connection type, model provider, server count, skill count, property count) all at `text-[9px]`.
- `text-[9px]` is an absolute pixel value — it does not respond to browser font-scale changes. At 100% zoom it renders at exactly 9 CSS pixels, making it extremely difficult to read.
- The badges also have varying heights (`h-3.5` and `h-4`) with the same absolute text, causing slight visual misalignment in the badge cluster.
- This matches the same pattern fixed in `agent-capabilities-sidebar.tsx` (chunk 5).

**setup.tsx — no issues**
- Simple two-item permission wizard. `max-w-screen-md` grid, `flex items-center justify-center` centering, `-mt-20` offset for visual balance. Well-structured; no overflow or font issues.

**panel.tsx — no issues**
- Uses `PanelResizeWrapper` with dynamic min heights (WAVEFORM_MIN_HEIGHT=150, PROGRESS_MIN_HEIGHT=200, TEXT_INPUT_MIN_HEIGHT=160). The waveform bar count is derived from the measured container width via ResizeObserver, making the visualizer fully responsive. Agent name and continue-conversation title both use `truncate` with explicit `max-w` constraints. Transcription preview uses `line-clamp-2`. No overflow or sizing issues found.

### Changes made

**settings-agents.tsx**
- Changed all `text-[9px]` → `text-[10px]` on the eight micro-badge types in `renderAgentList()`: Built-in, Default, Disabled, connection type, model provider ID, server count, skill count, and property count badges.

### Verified not broken
- TypeScript typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck` → exit 0.

### Follow-up areas for next chunk
- Do a final global grep for remaining `text-[9px]` across the entire renderer src to find any last stragglers missed so far.
- Audit `settings-mcp-tools.tsx` and `settings-capabilities.tsx` for overflow and font issues — not yet fully reviewed.
- Review `multi-agent-progress-view.tsx` for layout in panel overlay mode when many sessions are running.

## 2026-03-06 — chunk 6: bundle dialogs + settings-loops + mobile cross-check (all clear)

### Sources consulted
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx` (base component)
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/bundle-export-dialog.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/bundle-import-dialog.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/bundle-publish-dialog.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/settings-loops.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/mcp-elicitation-dialog.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/settings-whatsapp.tsx`
- `apps/mobile/src/ui/MarkdownRenderer.tsx`

### Findings

**bundle-export/publish dialogs — already safe**
- Initial concern: `DialogContent className="max-w-xl"` (export) and `max-w-2xl` (publish) had no explicit `max-h` or `overflow-y-auto`.
- Root cause check: base `dialog.tsx` already has `max-h-[calc(100%-40px)] overflow-y-auto w-[calc(100%-40px)] max-w-[calc(100%-40px)]` baked in. The additional `max-h` in bundle-import-dialog is redundant but harmless.
- **No changes needed** for any bundle dialogs.

**settings-loops.tsx — already safe**
- Outer container uses `flex h-full flex-col overflow-hidden` with `min-h-0 flex-1 overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden` on scroll area.
- Loop rows use `flex items-start justify-between gap-2` with `min-w-0 flex-1` on content and `flex shrink-0` on actions.
- `flex flex-wrap gap-3` on metadata row prevents overflow.
- **No changes needed**.

**mcp-elicitation-dialog.tsx — already safe**
- Uses `max-w-md` dialog with `max-h-[60vh] overflow-y-auto` on the form section.
- **No changes needed**.

**settings-whatsapp.tsx — minor note, no critical issues**
- Outer page uses `overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden` (correctly added on line 137).
- The 256×256 fixed QR code SVG might be tight at panel widths <320px, but WhatsApp is a desktop-only integration and such narrow widths are extreme edge cases.
- Status display row could benefit from `min-w-0` + `truncate` on the status text for very long usernames, but in practice usernames are short.
- **No critical issues; no changes made**.

**mobile MarkdownRenderer.tsx — not applicable**
- Uses React Native `StyleSheet.create` with device-independent units. Font sizes (13, 16, 15, 14, 11, 10) are appropriate for RN and not affected by browser CSS scaling.
- **No changes needed**.

### Changes made
None — all audited surfaces are already safe. No mechanical fixes to commit.

### Follow-up areas for next chunk
- `settings-agents.tsx` — complex page with agent list, accordions, and inline editors. Check for long agent name/description truncation and narrow-panel overflow.
- `setup.tsx` — the onboarding wizard flow (a different surface from onboarding.tsx).
- `panel.tsx` — the main panel page, wrapping tile-follow-up-input and the agent session view.

## 2026-03-06 — chunk 5: agent-capabilities-sidebar micro-fonts + providers overflow

### Sources consulted
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-capabilities-sidebar.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/settings-providers-and-models.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/mcp-config-manager.tsx` (reviewed, no changes needed)

### Issues found

**agent-capabilities-sidebar.tsx — micro-font badges and expand button**
- `text-[9px]` on three capability count badges (Skills, MCP Servers, Built-in Tools, lines 183/206/252) — badges showing "3/5" style counts were 9px, barely readable at 100% zoom.
- `text-[9px]` on the per-server tool-count expand button (line 221) — a button showing e.g. "4t ▸" was 9px absolute with no font scaling.
- `text-[8px]` on the agent connection type badge (line 333) — this was the smallest text found in the codebase at 8px. At 100% zoom it renders at 8 CSS pixels; with common browser text scaling it still stays fixed at 8px.

**settings-providers-and-models.tsx — horizontal scroll**
- The outer container used `overflow-auto` which enables both horizontal and vertical scrolling. On wide content inside (e.g., long provider API key input rows), this could create an undesirable horizontal scroll bar instead of wrapping.

**mcp-config-manager.tsx**
- Reviewed for server row overflow. Server row headers already use `min-w-0 flex-1` with `truncate` on the server name, and `shrink-0` on badge clusters — no changes needed.

### Changes made

**agent-capabilities-sidebar.tsx**
- Changed `text-[9px]` → `text-[10px]` on the Skills, MCP Servers, and Built-in Tools capability count badges.
- Changed `text-[9px]` → `text-[10px]` on the per-server tool-count expand button.
- Changed `text-[8px]` → `text-[10px]` and `h-3` → `h-3.5` on the agent connection type badge. Now consistent with all other micro-badges in the component.

**settings-providers-and-models.tsx**
- Changed `overflow-auto` → `overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden` on the outer container, preventing unintended horizontal scroll while preserving vertical scroll for tall content.

### Verified not broken
- TypeScript typecheck: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck` → exit 0.

### Follow-up areas for next chunk
- Audit the `bundle-export-dialog.tsx`, `bundle-import-dialog.tsx`, and `bundle-publish-dialog.tsx` for dialog sizing/narrow-window clipping.
- Audit the `settings-loops.tsx` repeat-task page for toolbar overflow and row truncation.
- Check mobile app (`apps/mobile/src/`) for matching issues per AGENTS.md cross-platform reminder — particularly agent progress display and session management.

## 2026-03-06 — chunk 4: skills toolbar overflow + text-input hint + agent-progress micro-fonts

### Sources consulted
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/settings-skills.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/text-input-panel.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tsx`
- Previous chunks 1–3 reviewed to avoid duplication.

### Highest-value area selected
Three distinct issues in frequently-used surfaces: skills settings toolbar overflow, panel input hint text clipping, and agent-progress micro-font accessibility.

### Issues found

**settings-skills.tsx — header toolbar row**
- The outer header `flex items-center justify-between` had no `flex-wrap`, no `min-w-0` on the title side.
- Normal mode toolbar: `Select` + `Open Folder` + `Workspace` + `Scan Folder` + `Import` dropdown = 5 buttons, no wrapping. At typical settings panel widths (~500 px) all 5 buttons + title text have horizontal pressure and would overflow at ~400 px.
- Select mode toolbar: `Select All/Deselect All` + `Export Bundle (N)` + `Delete (N)` + `Cancel` = 4 buttons with longer text, even tighter. At ~380 px they'd overflow.
- The button container div only had `flex gap-2` — no `flex-wrap`.

**text-input-panel.tsx — keyboard hint text**
- Line 177–178: The `flex items-center justify-between text-xs` row contained a full `<span>` with the text "Type your message • Enter to send • Shift+Enter for new line • Esc to cancel" (69 chars).
- No `min-w-0` or truncation on the span — at narrow panel widths (~280–350 px) this would overflow or push the `PredefinedPromptsMenu`/image button into the gutter.

**agent-progress.tsx — text-[9px] micro-font elements**
- `text-[9px]` used in 3 places: the "Copy" mini-button in expanded tool details, the char-count label next to "Result"/"Error", and both keyboard shortcut `kbd` badges (`Shift+Space`, `Space`).
- `text-[9px]` is an absolute pixel size — it does NOT scale with the user's system font scale setting. At any zoom level, these stay at a fixed 9 px which is borderline unreadable even at 100%.
- The expanded tool details container at `text-[10px]` passes its size to child `pre` blocks that lacked an explicit `text-[10px]`, relying on inheritance — fine in practice but fragile.

### Changes made

**settings-skills.tsx**
- Changed outer header row to `flex flex-wrap items-center justify-between gap-3`.
- Added `min-w-0` to the title `div`.
- Added `shrink-0` to the `Sparkles` icon.
- Changed both button containers (normal mode and select mode) from `flex gap-2` to `flex flex-wrap justify-end gap-2`, so buttons flow to a second line on narrow widths instead of overflowing.

**text-input-panel.tsx**
- Added `gap-2` to the hint row flexbox.
- Wrapped the hint text in `<span className="min-w-0 truncate">` to contain horizontal pressure.
- Added responsive inner spans: full hint text shown at `sm+`, abbreviated "Enter to send • Esc to cancel" shown below `sm`.

**agent-progress.tsx**
- Changed `text-[9px]` → `text-[10px]` on the inline "Copy" button text, the char-count label, the OK/ERR result badge, and both keyboard shortcut `kbd` elements (Shift+Space, Space).
- Added explicit `text-[10px]` to the `pre` blocks inside the expanded tool details div (error, content, "No content"), making the inherited font size explicit and consistent rather than relying on the parent div's inheritance.

### Verified not broken
- TypeScript typecheck passes: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck` → exit 0.
- No layout structure changes that would break existing snapshot tests.

### Follow-up areas for next chunk
- Audit `settings-models.tsx` / `settings-providers-and-models.tsx` for provider card overflow on narrow panel widths and missing min-w-0 on name columns.
- Inspect `mcp-config-manager.tsx` for server-row text overflow and narrow-panel clipping of the enable/disable toggle area.
- Check the `AgentCapabilitiesSidebar` for skill/agent name truncation issues.



## 2026-03-06 — chunk 1: settings form responsiveness

### Sources consulted
- `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md`
- renderer settings pages/components under `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/`

### Highest-value area selected
- Shared settings form rows (`components/ui/control.tsx`) used across dense settings surfaces.
- First concrete targets: `settings-general.tsx`, `settings-providers.tsx`, `settings-remote-server.tsx`.

### Issues found
- Control rows were hardcoded to a single horizontal layout with the value area capped at ~50%, which is fragile at narrow window widths and larger font scales.
- Long labels/tooltips/end descriptions could feel cramped or wrap poorly.
- Several settings selects used fixed pixel widths only (`w-[120px]`, `w-[180px]`, `w-[200px]`, etc.), increasing the chance of truncation or horizontal pressure.
- Settings pages used desktop-oriented horizontal padding and generic `overflow-auto`, making small-window behavior less polished.

### Changes made
- Updated `Control` to use a stacked-first responsive layout on small widths, switching to horizontal alignment at `sm` and preserving desktop balance.
- Allowed labels and tooltip rows to wrap cleanly with `break-words`/`flex-wrap`.
- Made `ControlGroup` end descriptions use full width on small screens and right-align only on larger widths.
- Changed the most visible fixed-width triggers/inputs in General, Providers, and Remote Server to `w-full sm:w-[...]` patterns.
- Tightened the audited settings page wrappers to `overflow-y-auto overflow-x-hidden px-4 sm:px-6` for better small-window behavior.
- Added a focused regression test for the shared `Control`/`ControlLabel` responsive class contract.

### Follow-up areas for next chunk
- Inspect the live settings sidebar + nested panel structure on `/settings/providers` for any double-panel/double-padding polish issues.
- Audit agents/settings list screens for long-name truncation and empty-state spacing.
- Check mobile/remote surfaces separately; this chunk was desktop renderer settings-focused.

## 2026-03-06 — chunk 2: sessions page header + onboarding

### Sources consulted
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/sessions.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/onboarding.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/session-grid.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/session-tile.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/sessions-kanban.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tsx`

### Issues found

**Sessions active header bar (sessions.tsx)**
- The left-side action group was `flex gap-2 items-center` with no wrapping — at narrow window widths the `AgentSelector + "Start with Text" + "Start with Voice" + PredefinedPromptsMenu` buttons would overflow without clipping or wrapping.
- The button labels ("Start with Text", "Start with Voice") were always rendered, taking unnecessary horizontal space on small windows.
- The right-side "Past Sessions" button also always showed its text label.
- The `justify-between` container had no padding normalization between sides on wrap.

**Sessions EmptyState (sessions.tsx)**
- Keybind hints row used `hidden md:flex` — completely invisible on windows narrower than `md` (768 px). This hides useful information from users on typical app panel sizes.
- The recent sessions list was constrained to `max-w-md` (~448 px) which looks too narrow on large screens; the action buttons area had no max-width alignment.
- Button row used `flex gap-3` without `flex-wrap` — could overflow on very narrow widths.

**Onboarding (onboarding.tsx)**
- The outer container was `flex h-dvh items-center justify-center p-10` with no overflow handling. On short-height displays (< ~700 px), the tall `AgentStep` or `WelcomeStep` content would be clipped with no scroll.
- A `-mt-10` negative margin was used to shift the centered block upward — a fragile visual hack.

### Changes made

**sessions.tsx — active header**
- Changed the outer bar to `flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2 px-3 py-2` so the two groups reflow on wrap instead of overflowing.
- Changed the left group to `flex flex-wrap gap-1.5 items-center min-w-0 flex-1` with correct `shrink-0` on icons.
- Wrapped "Start with Text" and "Start with Voice" button labels in `<span className="hidden sm:inline">` — icon-only on narrow windows, labeled at `sm+`.
- Wrapped "Past Sessions" button label in `<span className="hidden md:inline">` — icon-only at `sm`, labeled at `md+`.
- Tightened gaps throughout to `gap-1.5/gap-1` to reduce horizontal pressure.

**sessions.tsx — EmptyState**
- Removed `hidden md:flex` from the keybind hints row; replaced with `flex flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-3 text-xs` so hints show at all widths and wrap gracefully.
- Slightly reduced individual hint text size (already `text-xs`) and inlined key padding to `px-1.5`.
- Widened the action area and recent sessions list from `max-w-md` to `max-w-lg` for better use of space on larger windows.
- Added `flex-wrap` to the main button row so it wraps instead of overflowing.
- Standardized horizontal padding to `px-6 py-8`.

**onboarding.tsx**
- Changed outer container to `flex h-dvh overflow-y-auto` — removes the fixed vertical centering that caused clipping.
- The inner content block now uses `w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto my-auto px-6 py-10` to stay centered vertically when there's space, and scroll when there isn't.
- Removed the `p-10` on the outer container and the `-mt-10` negative margin hack.

### Verified not broken
- `session-grid.tsx`: uses ResizeObserver for dynamic tile sizing — no overflow issues found.
- `session-tile.tsx`: header uses `flex-1 min-w-0` + `truncate` on title — correct.
- `sessions-kanban.tsx`: uses `overflow-x-auto` with `min-w-[300px]` per column — correct.
- `agent-progress.tsx` tile header: icon-only action buttons, title with `truncate` — correct.

### Follow-up areas for next chunk
- Audit the panel overlay views (`panel.tsx`, `overlay-follow-up-input.tsx`) for button/input overflow on narrow floating windows.
- Audit the memories page and agent config list for long-name/description truncation.
- Check font scaling edge cases (system font size 125–200%) in agent-progress messages/tool outputs.

## 2026-03-06 — chunk 3: memories page layout + settings-agents toolbar + agent-progress overlay header

### Sources consulted
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/memories.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/settings-agents.tsx`
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/agent-progress.tsx` (overlay/default variant header, lines ~3333-3434)
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/pages/panel.tsx` (min-width constants, waveform layout)
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/overlay-follow-up-input.tsx`

### Issues found

**memories.tsx — search + filter row**
- `flex items-center gap-3` outer row had no `flex-wrap` — at windows narrower than the combined width of the search box + 5 filter buttons (~650px), the filter row would overflow the container and become partially hidden under the scroll boundary.
- Filter button container `flex items-center gap-2` also lacked `flex-wrap`, so the 5 buttons (all/critical/high/medium/low) had no fallback to a second line.
- The `max-w-md` search input had `flex-1` without `min-w-0`, so at very narrow widths the input could force the layout rather than shrinking.

**memories.tsx — header action buttons**
- The `flex items-start justify-between gap-4` header row had `<div className="flex gap-2">` for the action buttons without `flex-wrap` — at ≤ 480px window widths the "Open Folder" / "Workspace" buttons could overflow.
- The title div lacked `min-w-0`, preventing proper truncation behavior.

**settings-agents.tsx — toolbar row**
- `flex items-center justify-end gap-2 mb-4` contained 5 action buttons (Import Bundle, Export Bundle, Export for Hub, Rescan Files, Add Agent) without `flex-wrap`. At settings panel widths below ~680px these would overflow or clip.

**agent-progress.tsx — overlay/default variant header (lines ~3334)**
- The outer header div had `flex items-center justify-between` with no `overflow-hidden`. The right-side metadata cluster `flex items-center gap-3` contained up to 6 elements simultaneously (profile name, ACP badge, model info, context fill bar, iteration counter, 2 icon buttons). At the panel's minimum width (~312px), all 6 elements at `gap-3` spacing would overflow by ~80–90px with no fallback.
- The iteration counter and action buttons had no `shrink-0`, so they would compress with the rest of the cluster making them inaccessible at narrow widths.

### Changes made

**memories.tsx**
- Changed outer search+filter row to `flex flex-wrap items-center gap-3`.
- Changed search `div` to `relative min-w-0 flex-1 max-w-md` (added `min-w-0`).
- Changed filter button container to `flex flex-wrap items-center gap-1.5` (was `gap-2`).
- Changed header outer `div` to `flex flex-wrap items-start justify-between gap-4`.
- Changed title child `div` to `min-w-0`.
- Changed header action button container to `flex flex-wrap gap-2 shrink-0`.

**settings-agents.tsx**
- Changed toolbar row to `flex flex-wrap items-center justify-end gap-2 mb-4` — buttons now reflow to a second line at narrow settings panel widths.

**agent-progress.tsx (overlay variant)**
- Changed outer header `div` to add `gap-2 overflow-hidden`.
- Changed left status `div` to `flex items-center gap-2 shrink-0` so status text is never compressed.
- Changed right metadata `div` from `flex items-center gap-3` to `flex min-w-0 items-center gap-1.5 overflow-hidden` so items can shrink.
- Added `shrink-0 tabular-nums` to iteration counter span.
- Added `shrink-0` to minimize button, kill button, and close button so action buttons are never hidden by compression.

### Verified not broken
- TypeScript typecheck passes (`pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop typecheck`): exit 0.
- `overlay-follow-up-input.tsx`: Already uses compact `px-3 py-2 gap-2` row. Icon-only buttons with fixed `h-7 w-7` — at the panel minimum width the input row gracefully fills remaining space. No changes needed.
- `panel.tsx` waveform UI: Uses `ResizeObserver`-driven dynamic bar count + pixel-perfect sizing. Not affected by these changes.

### Follow-up areas for next chunk
- Font scale audit (125%–200% system font scale) on agent-progress message content and tool output `pre` blocks — verify `text-[9px]`/`text-[10px]`/`text-[11px]` sizes remain readable.
- Check `active-agents-sidebar.tsx` and `app-layout.tsx` for sidebar collapse/expand responsiveness.
- Audit `past-sessions-dialog.tsx` for long session title truncation and narrow dialog layout.
