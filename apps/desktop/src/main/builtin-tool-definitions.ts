/**
 * Builtin Tool Definitions - Dependency-Free Module
 *
 * This module contains the static definitions for built-in MCP tools.
 * It is intentionally kept free of dependencies on other app modules
 * to avoid circular import issues.
 *
 * The tool execution handlers are in builtin-tools.ts, which can safely
 * import from services that might also need access to these definitions.
