/**
 * Runtime Tool Definitions - Dependency-Free Module
 *
 * This module contains the static definitions for DotAgents runtime tools.
 * It is intentionally kept free of dependencies on other app modules
 * to avoid circular import issues.
 *
 * The tool execution handlers are in runtime-tools.ts, which can safely
 * import from services that might also need access to these definitions.
