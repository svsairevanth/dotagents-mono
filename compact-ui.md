## Compact UI Coverage Ledger

### Desktop checked screens / flows / states
- No desktop surfaces have screenshot-backed live verification yet in this loop; renderer startup remains blocked before first capture.

### Mobile checked screens / flows / states
- [x] Mobile Settings root screen on initial app launch (`App.tsx` initial route `Settings`) — source-level review only this iteration because Expo web runtime was blocked before launch.

- [ ] Mobile empty / loading / error / success / disabled / long-content states
- [ ] Mobile small phone width / larger mobile web width

### Reproduced issues
- [x] Mobile Settings root screen had redundant chrome: navigation header already labels the route as `DotAgents`, while `SettingsScreen` also rendered a large in-content `Settings` title above the connection card.

### Improved
- [x] Removed the duplicate in-content `Settings` title from the mobile root settings surface to reduce non-informational vertical space and let the connection card surface sooner.
- [x] Repositioned shared desktop settings helper tooltips to prefer a vertical opening direction (`top`) with a slightly tighter offset so explanatory overlays are less likely to spill over neighboring switches/selects in dense settings rows.
- [x] Strengthened desktop tooltip regression coverage to assert the shared settings-row composition in `Control` + `ControlLabel` and a dependency-free audit of a concrete `settings-general` row.

### Verified
- [x] Source-level regression coverage added in `apps/mobile/tests/settings-screen-density.test.js`.
- [x] Targeted verification passed: `node --test apps/mobile/tests/settings-screen-density.test.js apps/mobile/tests/navigation-header.test.js`.
- [x] Dependency-free desktop regression coverage added in `apps/desktop/tests/control-tooltip-density.test.mjs`.
- [x] Targeted desktop source verification passed: `node --test apps/desktop/tests/control-tooltip-density.test.mjs`.

### Blocked
- [x] Live mobile runtime inspection blocked: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/mobile web` failed with `node_modules missing`, `expo: command not found`, and `ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_RUN_FIRST_FAIL`.
- [x] Live desktop runtime inspection not attempted after the same dependency blocker pattern because local app dependencies appear unavailable.
- [x] Live desktop renderer inspection remained blocked this iteration: `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9333 ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS="--inspect=9339" pnpm dev -- -dui` failed during `@dotagents/shared build` with `tsup: command not found`, `spawn ENOENT`, and `node_modules missing` warnings.
- [x] Targeted desktop Vitest execution remained blocked for the same reason: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop test:run -- src/renderer/src/components/ui/control.test.tsx` failed before Vitest ran because `pnpm -w run build:shared` could not find `tsup`.

### Still uncertain
- [ ] Desktop renderer / Electron surfaces still need first live attachment and screenshot evidence once dependencies are installed.
- [ ] Desktop settings helper-tooltip hover occlusion remains un-reproduced in a live renderer; the current coverage is shared-component/source-level only until the desktop runtime can launch for screenshot-backed review.
- [ ] Desktop settings surfaces remain unchecked at runtime; the shared settings-row audit is not a substitute for live renderer coverage.
- [ ] Mobile chat composer, header action row, and agent selector chip still need live narrow-width review for density and possible control crowding.

### Iterations

#### Iteration 1
Evidence
- Scope: Initialize compact UI ledger and prepare runtime-first inspection workflow for desktop/mobile.
- Before evidence: `compact-ui.md` was missing; reviewed `apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md` for renderer/main-process inspection workflow.
- Change: Created this checklist-driven coverage ledger with explicit cross-platform sections and an evidence contract.
- After evidence: `compact-ui.md` now exists and can be updated as a running coverage map.
- Verification commands/run results: `view compact-ui.md` previously returned file not found; `view apps/desktop/DEBUGGING.md` confirmed recommended desktop debug ports and mobile Expo web workflow.
- Blockers/remaining uncertainty: No live runtime attached yet; next step is to inspect a live desktop or mobile surface and capture before-state visual evidence.

#### Iteration 2
Evidence
- Scope: Mobile root Settings screen decluttering on the initial launch surface.
- Before evidence: Source-backed observation only because runtime was blocked — `SettingsScreen` rendered `<Text style={styles.h1}>Settings</Text>` above the connection card while `App.tsx` already configured the root stack screen title as `DotAgents`; attempted Expo web launch failed before any screenshot capture.
- Change: Removed the duplicate in-content `Settings` heading from `apps/mobile/src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx` and added `apps/mobile/tests/settings-screen-density.test.js` to preserve header orientation while preventing the redundant title from coming back.
- After evidence: Source now starts the Settings scroll content directly with the connection card, reducing top-of-screen chrome on the mobile root settings surface.
- Verification commands/run results: `pnpm --filter @dotagents/mobile web` → failed (`expo: command not found`, `node_modules missing`, exit 1). `node --test apps/mobile/tests/settings-screen-density.test.js apps/mobile/tests/navigation-header.test.js` → passed (3 tests, 0 failures).
- Blockers/remaining uncertainty: No before/after screenshots were possible because Expo web could not launch without installed dependencies; visual validation of real spacing and any neighboring layout effects remains pending once runtime access is restored.

#### Iteration 3
Evidence
- Scope: Desktop shared settings helper-tooltip overlay safety for dense settings rows.
- Before evidence: Source-backed risk review only because runtime was blocked — `ControlLabel` in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/ui/control.tsx` rendered helper tooltips with `side="right"` and `align="start"`, while desktop settings rows place the interactive control in the right column (`sm:max-w-[48%]`), making the tooltip most likely to open into neighboring switches/selects. No live reproduction or screenshot-backed review was achieved in this iteration.
- Change: Updated `ControlLabel` to prefer `side="top"` with `sideOffset={6}` so helper overlays open vertically instead of into the settings control column, and added an initial regression assertion in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/ui/control.test.tsx` for the new placement.
- After evidence: Source now positions the shared desktop helper tooltip above the label, reducing the chance that hover help occludes or steals clicks from adjacent controls in dense settings forms, but the issue remained source-identified rather than live-reproduced.
- Verification commands/run results: `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9333 ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS="--inspect=9339" pnpm dev -- -dui` → failed during predev (`tsup: command not found`, `node_modules missing`, exit 1). `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop test:run -- src/renderer/src/components/ui/control.test.tsx` → failed before Vitest startup because `pnpm -w run build:shared` could not find `tsup` (exit 1). The prior draft's redacted `node --input-type=module -e` fallback is not auditable and should not be treated as verified evidence.
- Blockers/remaining uncertainty: No before/after screenshots were possible because the desktop renderer could not start without installed dependencies; live hover validation is still needed to confirm the tooltip no longer covers nearby controls at real window sizes.

#### Iteration 4
Evidence
- Scope: QA remediation for desktop tooltip verification accuracy and regression coverage strength.
- Before evidence: `compact-ui.md` overstated the desktop tooltip work as reproduced/checked/verified despite only source-level evidence, `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/ui/control.test.tsx` asserted only `TooltipContent` props in isolation, and `electron_execute_electron-native` returned `Failed to list CDP targets. Make sure Electron is running with --inspect flag.`.
- Change: Updated `apps/desktop/src/renderer/src/components/ui/control.test.tsx` to compose a full shared settings row with an adjacent right-hand control, added `apps/desktop/tests/control-tooltip-density.test.mjs` to tie the shared tooltip placement to the concrete `Main Agent Mode` row in `settings-general.tsx`, and corrected the ledger so desktop runtime coverage is recorded as blocked/uncertain instead of reproduced/checked.
- After evidence: The desktop tooltip regression coverage now checks both the shared row split (`sm:max-w-[52%]` + `sm:max-w-[48%]`) and the top-opening tooltip contract, while the ledger explicitly treats live renderer validation as pending rather than complete.
- Verification commands/run results: `node --test apps/desktop/tests/control-tooltip-density.test.mjs` → passed (3 tests, 0 failures, exit 0). `pnpm --filter @dotagents/desktop test:run -- src/renderer/src/components/ui/control.test.tsx` → failed before Vitest startup because `pnpm -w run build:shared` could not find `tsup` (exit 1). `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9333 ELECTRON_EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS="--inspect=9339" pnpm dev -- -dui` → failed during predev with `tsup: command not found` before a renderer target was available (exit 1).
- Blockers/remaining uncertainty: No before/after screenshots were possible because the desktop renderer still cannot launch without the missing desktop/shared toolchain dependencies, so live hover/click interference remains unverified until that blocker is removed.
